# Scala 3 Project Template
This repository is a template for a Scala3 project, which includes code styling
([ScalaFormatter](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/)) and code linting tools 
([WartRemover](https://www.wartremover.org/)). 

The project starts with preconfigured continuous integration for testing and 
deployment of **sources** and **documentation** on both GitHub and Maven Central.
